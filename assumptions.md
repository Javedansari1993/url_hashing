## Assumptions

- The system assumes that the input URLs provided by the user are valid and well-formed URLs.
- The system does not restrict the length of the URLs or ignore any query parameters. It preserves the original URL structure while generating the hashed URL.
- The system tracks clicks on the hashed URLs for analytics purposes. However, the hashed URLs can be made privacy-aware to ensure user privacy.
